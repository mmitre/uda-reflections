-- What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates the metadata for the new repository. Otherwise, git wouldn't know how to accept commits or track files.

-- How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offer?
It allows us to group all files that were updated as part of one logical change so that they can be committed together.

-- How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Even if you have changed other files, you can stage only those that make a specific logical change.
